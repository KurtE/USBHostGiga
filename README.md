# [ALPHA] USBHost library for Arduino Giga R1

This library has been created to overcome the limitations of https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_USBHostMbed5 when it's time to talk with USB Low Speed devices like keyboards and mice.

The APIs are very minimal ans subject to change; please just use for evaluation purposes.
